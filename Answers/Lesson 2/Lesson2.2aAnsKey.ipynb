    "### The Chinese zodiac is a classification scheme based on the lunar calendar that assigns an animal and its reputed attributes to each year in a repeating 12-year cycle. Each year represents a different animal, 2021 represents the year of the Ox. The animal that represents a corresponding year can be calculated by using modulus (%):\r\n",
