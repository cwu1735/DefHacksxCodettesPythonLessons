    "## Lesson 3.2: Addition Quiz\r\n",
    "### In this project, we will be making a quiz where the user will input the number of addition questions that they want. The program will then give them one question by randomly generating an addition question, say if the answer is right or wrong, and repeat until the amount of questions that the user has asked for is reached. At the end of all the questions, the program should also tell the user how many questions out of the total the user got correctly. \r\n",
