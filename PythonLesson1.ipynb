    "### Hello everyone, welcome to the first of many Python lessons that we will have this year where you will get a chance to learn the basics of Python. The end goal is to be able to create projects of your choice by the time the Hackathon comes around in the second semester. In this lesson we will be going over printing, variables, inputs, math, and if statements. If you have any questions, you may ask any of the DefHacks or Codettes execs or consult with the answer key. Good luck!"

    "# **Variables**\n",
    "### Variables in programming are the same as in math. They symbollically represent anything you want! In programming, we use variables with intuitive names to make reading code much easier. Variables can contain letters, numbers, or _ , are case sensitive, and can be any (reasonable) length.\n",

    "slashes\\and\\colons:are\\bad:<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically in coding, we like to pick names for our variables that make sense. Also, variables with multiple words should start with a lower case letter, then use upper case letters for following words. This is not a rule in coding, just a convention (something most coders do so they can understand each other's work). \n",
    "\n",
    "### There are four main types of variables: <br/>\n",
    "**Boolean**: A true of false statement <br/>\n",

The other types of variables should not be put in quotation marks as they are not strings. We can also see that we added a \"+\" in the print statement to combine the text (string) that you had in the print statement already and the variable that was just made. Now try and see if you can make your own print statement in the following block of code that says: My name is *yourName* and I'm *yourAge* years old. You will need to make two different variables, one for your name (myName) and one for your age (myAge). \n",
